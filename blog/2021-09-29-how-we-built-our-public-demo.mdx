Metriql doesn't have a user interface that lets you analyze the data because it's [Headless BI](https://metriql.com/introduction/intro). However, it comes with a dashboard that enables you to use the integrations that we have. Here is how it looks like:

We built an [open-source](https://github.com/metriql/metriql-public-demo) public demo that you can deploy to your Heroku, Google Cloud, or any cloud provider that supports Docker deployments. The demo makes use of two dbt seeds called `customer` and `orders`. We load the data into the database and define metrics with Metriql. It doesn't need to transform the data. Instead, it exposes the fact tables as Metriql datasets. Here is how it looks like:

```yml
version: 2
seeds:
  - name: customer
    meta: 
      metriql:
        measures:
          total_customers:
            aggregation: count
    columns:
      - name: c_custkey
      - name: c_name
        meta:
          metriql.dimension:
            type: string
      - name: c_nationkey
      - name: c_mktsegment
  - name: orders
    meta:
      metriql:
        measures:
          total_orders:
            aggregation: count
        relations:
          customer:
            to: ref('customer')
            source: o_custkey
            target: c_custkey
            relationship: many_to_one
            type: left_join
    columns:
      - name: o_orderkey
      - name: o_custkey
        meta:
          metriql.measure:
            name: unique_users
            aggregation: count_unique
      - name: o_orderstatus
      - name: o_totalprice
        meta:
          metriql.measure:
            aggregation: sum
            name: total_price
      - name: o_orderdate
      - name: o_clerk
      - name: o_shippriority
```

As you see, we have `customer` relation from the `orders` dataset, and we defined measures for both of our datasets. Our public demo uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/metriql/metriql-public-demo/actions) to run the dbt, wait for dbt to update the seeds, create the manifest.json file, and update the [dbt Docs](https://metriql.github.io/metriql-public-demo) on Github Pages. Our manifest.json file is hosted [here](https://metriql.github.io/metriql-public-demo/manifest.json), and we pass the URL to Metriql container along with the profiles.yml file stored in repository secrets. Metriql updates the data models automatically once you push your code and wait for the continuous integration process to finish. After that, you can use your preferred data or visualization tool to analyze the data consistently.

> Pro Tip: You can also use [Scheduled Events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) in Github actions if you want to run dbt periodically. dbt Cloud works excellent for production environments, but it might be easier to run dbt as part of your continuous integration process that updates services such as Metriql.

If you're a SQL heavy user, feel free to run queries similar to this one using your favorite SQL client:

```sql
SELECT o_orderstatus, "customer.total_customers" FROM "ref('orders')"
```

Note that we don't allow aggregation functions or GROUP BY statements in MQL. The data model should be defined as code for the data tools to consume the data reliably. Metriql automatically generates the SQL query for the target data warehouse similar to the query below:

```sql
SELECT 
    "model_my_new_project_orders"."o_orderstatus" AS "o_orderstatus",
    count(*) AS "customer_total_customers"
FROM "orders" AS "model_my_new_project_orders"
 LEFT JOIN "customer" AS "model_my_new_project_customer" ON ("model_my_new_project_orders"."o_custkey" = "model_my_new_project_customer"."c_custkey") 
    GROUP BY
    1 
```

Metriql parses the MQL query sent from the data tools, creates a segmentation report under the hood, and compiles it to SQL query, and applies the projections. MQL should not have side effects such as using an aggregation function `array_agg` might cause the data-warehouse to be bloated. We should define the data model as code and expose relevant measures and dimensions to the data tools to analyze the data in different ways such as [segmentation](https://metriql.com/query/segmentation), [funnel](https://metriql.com/query/funnel), and [retention](https://metriql.com/query/retention).

> One more pro tip: If you want to create dimensional models automatically and speed up your queries, you can use [Aggregates](https://metriql.com/introduction/aggregates).

We do have native [integration with Superset](https://metriql.com/integrations/bi-tools/superset), which is the most popular open-source BI tool. Since Superset supports metric definitions already, our native integration uses your Superset credentials to update the datasets, the metric definitions, and the metadata. You can even add Superset related tags to your YML files as follows:


```
seeds:
  - name: customer
    meta: 
      metriql:
        measures:
          total_customers:
            aggregation: count
            report:
              superset:
                certification_details: buremba
```

Here is how it looks like:

You visit the dashboard and connect Metriql from your favorite data tool, we have +16 integrations at the time of writing, and it's growing quickly! While we're working on integrating Metriql with most of the tools, eventually, we believe that  We even got our [first contribution](https://github.com/metriql/metriql.com/pull/17) from the data tool vendor, [Seektable](https://seektable.com), thanks [Vitaliy](https://metriql.slack.com/archives/C022QDKR95G/p1632472978012200)!

> Promise, last pro tip: We will release a series of tutorials about how you can set up end-to-end analytics pipelines with different open-source data tools from data collection to visualization tools. Stay tuned! ðŸ¤ž
