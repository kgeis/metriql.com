A dataset represents a dataset in your data warehouse. metriql automatically creates datasets from your dbt [`models`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models), [`sources`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources), and [`seeds`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds). A dataset has three important properties:

**dimension** lets you drill down into the dataset, it can be used to filter query results. It can be either a column in your table or an SQL expression that processes a single row and returns a value.

**measure** is a field that uses an SQL aggregate function, such as `count`, `sum`, or `average`. Measures can be used to aggregate dimensions. For example, measures for a `Sales` model might include total items sold (a count), total sales price (a sum), and the average sales price (an average). 

**relation** defines a join in between the datasets. metriql automatically generates SQL join logic to bring in all fields from another dataset correctly then the user analyzes a specific dataset.

## Create datasets from dbt metrics

:::warning
The feature is in beta and the API is unstable for now.
:::

We support dbt's metrics natively. The datasets that is created via dbt metrics only have single measures and the dimensions are inherited from the base model / source / seed if you use `meta.metriql` in them. Please refer to dbt's metrics feature to [learn more about the definitions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics).


## Create datasets from dbt models

You can map your columns as dimensions and measures under the `meta` property of `columns` as follows:

```yml
models:
 - name: customers
   columns:
     - name: country_code
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: city
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: total_customers
       description: total number of customers defined as count(*) in sql
       meta:
         metriql.measure:
    	    aggregation: sum
```

In addition to column mapping, you can also create custom measures and dimensions by defining them under `meta` of the model:

```yml
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      metriql:
         measures:
            total_rows:
               aggregation: count
         dimensions:
            full_location:
	            sql: CONCAT({TABLE}.country, {TABLE}.city)   
	            type: string
```

You can see the full list of properties that you can use under `model.meta` and `column.meta` [here](/reference/dataset.md).

## Create datasets from dbt sources

In case you want to create models that point to tables in your database, you can make use of dbt's source properties as follows:

```yml
sources:
  - name: raw_events
    tables:
      - name: pageview
        meta:
          metriql:
             measures:
                total_pageviews:
                aggregation: count
        columns:
          - name: url
            meta:
              metriql.dimension:
                type: string
```

If you're analyzing the time-series data, you can also define `mappings` so that metriql understands your data in a better way and lets you access specific features such as funnel and retention:


```yml
models:
  - name: events
    meta:
      metriql:
	      mappings:
	        event_timestamp: event_occurred_at
	        userId: user_id
```

## Create datasets from dbt seeds

#### Exposing your seeds to the end-users
Since seeds are usually used to enrich the data, we don't create models from `seeds` by default. However; you can expose them to the end-users if you enable the `seeds` to have appeared in dbt docs:

```yml
seeds:
  - name: countries
    docs:
      show: true
    meta:
      metriql:
        measures:
        #
    columns:
      - name: iso_code
        meta:
          metriql.dimension:
      - name: user_friendly_name
        meta:
          metriql.dimension: 
            type: string
models:
  - name: pageviews
    meta:
      metriql:
        relations:
          countries:
            to: ref('countries')
            sql: "{TABLE}.country = {TARGET}.iso_code"
            type: left_join 
            relationship: many_to_many
```

metriql automatically creates the relation from `pageview` to a hidden `countries` model so that the users can drill down by `user_friendly_name` when they're analyzing `pageviews`.

### Supported tests

We make use of your dbt test definitions in order to understand your data in a better way. Here is the list of column tests we currently support:

* `unique` marks the dimension as primary key. 
<!-- * metriql needs a primary key dimension to calculate [symmetric aggregates](/reference/relation/#symmetric-aggregates) as there must be a unique key in a model. -->
* `not_null` hides the `is not set` filter to the user in the user interface.
* `accepted_values` makes metriql suggests the values to the end-user in the user interface. It disables the automatic suggestion in favor of performance.
