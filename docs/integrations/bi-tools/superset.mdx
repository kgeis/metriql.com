You can connect to metriql from Superset using Trino driver to query the datasets from both SQL Lab and [query builder](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data). In addition to the Trino driver, we also provide a native integration with our [open-source Superset driver](https://github.com/metriql/metriql-superset) to syncronize Metriql datasets as Superset datasets with metrics & column definitions.

Once you start Metriql, you should enter your Superset URL and credentials in the dashboard as follows:

When you click synchronize database button, we create all the Metriql datasets under the data or edit them if they're already created.

### FAQ

#### Why don't you use Superset API?

While Superset provides an API, it doesn't let updating / creating datasets and databases. Therefore, we create session tokens using internal APIs and interact with the internal APIs.

#### Do you support Preset Cloud?

Yes! Preset offers [an API](https://docs.preset.io/docs/using-the-preset-api) in their Enterprise Plan, and you can use the API tokens to be able to synchronize the metrics of Superset deployments in your Preset account. The `token` in the picture below should be passed as `--superset-username`, and the value of `secret` should be passed as `--superset-password`:

### I'm not able to connect Metriql using SSL.

You need to enter the following setting in your Superset connection:

```json
  "engine_params": {"connect_args": {"http_scheme": "https"}},
```
