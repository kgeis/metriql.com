# SeekTable

SeekTable is a BI tool for data exploration and operational reporting. It supports [Presto as a data source](https://www.seektable.com/help/presto-trino-pivot-table) which is suitable for Metriql as well:

Once you connect to Metriql, you can create pivot tables/charts and run queries on your data warehouse (without need to write a SQL code):

Under the hood SeekTable wraps cube's base query with `GROUP BY`, to avoid that a flat-table report type may be used instead.
