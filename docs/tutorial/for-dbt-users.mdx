# Introduction for dbt users

## Metriql CLI

<YoutubeVideo id="Gz_6EOSDDSs" />

<br/><br/>

All dbt projects are also valid Metriql projects. Metriql creates [datasets](/introduction/creating-datasets) from all your dbt `models`, `seeds`, and `sources` if you have `meta.metriql` property for these dbt resources. The only missing part is the metric (aka measure) definitions. Metriql makes use of dbt's `meta` properties so you can model your data by adding extra properties to the [`meta`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/meta) field. 

Metriql automatically creates dimensions for each column definitions in your resource files and you can add your custom metric definitions under `meta` property as follows:

```yml
models:
 - name: customers
   meta:
     metriql
   columns:
     - name: country_code
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: city
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: total_customers
       description: total number of customers defined as count(*) in sql
       meta:
         metriql.measure:
    	    aggregation: sum
```

In addition to column mapping, you can also create custom measures and dimensions by defining them under `meta` or the model:

```yml
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      metriql:
         measures:
            total_rows:
               aggregation: count
         dimensions:
            full_location:
	            sql: CONCAT({TABLE}.country, {TABLE}.city)   
	            type: string
```

Congratulations, you created your first dataset in dbt! Now, we need to use Metriql CLI to expose out dataset:

* Run [`metriql serve`](/metriql-cli/cli-overview#installation) command.

You can follow the links below as the next step:

* Learn more about the data modeling concept in [Creating Datasets](/introduction/creating-datasets).
* See [full reference](/reference/dataset) of dataset properties.
* Start [consuming your data](/query/introduction).
