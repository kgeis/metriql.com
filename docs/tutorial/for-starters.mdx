# Introduction for starters

## Metriql CLI

<YoutubeVideo id="Gz_6EOSDDSs" />

<br/><br/>

1. [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation)
2. Run `dbt init [project_name]` ([See docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/init))
3. [Configure dbt profiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile)
4. Create a file called `source.yml` under `/models` directory.
5. Paste the following content:

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2
sources:
  - name: first_dataset
    tables:
      - name: [YOUR_TABLE_NAME_IN_DATABASE]
        meta:
          metriql:
            total_rows:
              aggregation: count
        columns:
          - name: [YOUR_COLUMN_NAME_IN_TABLE]
            meta:
              metriql.dimension:
                name: example_dimension #if you don't define `name`, the default is column name
                type: string  #change this if the column type is not string, see [available types](/reference/field#type)
```

</File>

This snippet above creates a dbt source, and each dbt source becomes a dataset in metriql. The dataset measure called `total_rows`, and dimension called `example_dimension`. 
Please see the [dbt sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources#declaring-a-source) to learn more about the concept. We use `meta` properties of dbt resources and support all the dbt resources including models, sources, and seeds. See [dataset properties](/reference/dataset) for all the metriql-specific properties. 

5. Run `dbt list`
6. [Install and run metriql](/metriql-cli/cli-overview#installation)

Congrats! You now have a REST API to run queries on your database. The next step is to learn [how to query your data.](/query/introduction)
