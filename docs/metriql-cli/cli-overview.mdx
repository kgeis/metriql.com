# Metriql CLI

Metriql CLI has two commands:

* [`generate`](generate) generates [Aggregate](/introduction/aggregates) dbt models inside your dbt project

* [`serve`](serve) creates an HTTP server that lets you connect your datasets from your data tools.

# Installation

Please note that you need to [install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) to use metriql. 

We recommend you use install metriql using one of three tried and tested methods:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    { label: 'Docker', value: 'docker', },
    { label: 'Install via binary', value: 'binary', },
    { label: 'From Source', value: 'source', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), and [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation#homebrew). Then, run:

``` bash
brew update
brew tap metriql/metriql
brew install metriql
```

You can also upgrade metriql as follows:

``` bash
brew update
brew upgrade metriql
```

Test your installation with `metriql --help`:
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="binary">

1. Download the file `metriql-[VERSION]-bundle.tar.gz` [on Github](https://github.com/metriql/metriql/packages/820012).
2. Extract tar.gz file

Test the CLI application with  `./bin/metriql --help`:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker">

``` bash
docker pull buremba/metriql:latest
```

And run the following command:


``` bash
export DBT_PROJECT_DIR=${PWD}
export DBT_PROFILES_DIR=${HOME}/.dbt
export METRIQL_PORT=5656

docker run -it -p "${METRIQL_PORT}:5656" -v "${DBT_PROJECT_DIR}:/root/app" -v "${DBT_PROFILES_DIR}:/root/.dbt" -e METRIQL_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 -e DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/root/app buremba/metriql \
 serve
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="source">

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/metriql/metriql.git
cd metriql
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

Run the following command:

``` bash
target/metriql-*-bundle/metriql-*/bin/metriql --help
```

If you want to run the application via an IDE, the main class should be `com.metriql.ServiceStarterKt`, pass `--help` as program arguments:

## Supported dbt deployments

The CLI interacts with the dbt via Metadata API. You need to run `dbt compile` and generate the `target/manifest.json` file separately from Metriql and pass the URI of the `manifest.json` file as an option. 
Metriql uses `DBT_MANIFEST_JSON` environment variable and `--manifest-json` argument when accessing the manifest.json file URI. The following URI schemes are valid at the moment:


:::info
If you want to update the datasets without restarting Metriql, you can use Metriql's [Update Manifest API endpoint](https://metriql.com/rest-api-endpoints#operation/UpdateManifest) to fetch the manifest.json from the source URL.
:::

### `file`
If you're running dbt and Metriql locally in the same environment, you can pass the manifest file location as file URI.

Example:
```
file:/Users/myuser/Code/metriql-demo-tpch/target/manifest.json
```

### `http` and `https`

If your dbt Docs is public or you expose manifest.json in a public way, you can pass the URL when starting Metriql.

Example:
```
https://metriql.github.io/metriql-public-demo/manifest.json
```

### `dbt-cloud`
If you're running dbt via dbt Cloud, you can access the manifest.json file via dbt Cloud API. 
You need to generate an API token on [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/api/) and and pass the Job id to Metriql so that it can interact with the API to fetch the manifest.json artifact.
Please note that you need to be on a paid plan to be able to use the API.

Example:
```
dbt-cloud://600685b9b9c62dfz8d9696e03ed8e1c15364dcd8@cloud.getdbt.com/30390?job_id=37095
```
