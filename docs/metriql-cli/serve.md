If you want to consume the data or share your metrics via REST API, metriql has an embedded HTTP server that reads your `manifest.json` file generated as dbt artifact and serves it to the end-user.

Please see [REST API](/rest-api) for specification.

:::info
If you're using BigQuery with `gcloud` CLI and test Metriql locally, you should map the credentials as follows:

```
-v "${HOME}/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud"
```
